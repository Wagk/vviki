## Goals ##

A wiki that can be displayed on and navigated via the terminal

+ Something like [taskwarrior][1] 
+ Something like [jrnl][2]
+ Something that encrypts the data
+ Something that stores it all in text format
	- That is human readable
	- That looks like someone organised it neatly by hand
	- That can be edited using your favorite text editor
	- That can be translated to and from any format you want
